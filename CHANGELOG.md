## 1.0.47 - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Interactive 3D furniture previews with orbit, zoom, dimensions, and explicit
  placement.
- Room and object-type catalog navigation alongside search and recent items.
- A versioned Cloudflare R2 catalog that loads additional CC0 models on demand,
  caches validated manifests, and falls back safely when offline.
- The first cloud catalog batch: 32 optimized Quaternius CC0 furniture and
  interior models.
- More realistic sample homes using bundled GLBs for 87 of 149 placements.
- Direct furniture placement from 3D build mode.
- Room-bounded wall painting, including independent finishes for adjacent rooms
  that share one long structural wall.

### Improved

- Reduced 2D canvas pixel cost on high-density phones.
- Changed the main 3D orbit view and furniture previews to render on demand.
- Reduced mobile 3D resolution and environment-map cost under load.
- Reduced furniture drag raycasting to one interaction proxy per object.
- Improved build-mode guidance, catalog grouping, mobile controls, and safe-area
  spacing.

### Fixed

- Wall paint no longer crosses room boundaries simply because rooms share a
  continuous wall.
- Furniture dragging explicitly requests frames in demand-rendering mode.
- Interrupted Android gestures no longer leave orbit controls stuck.
- Missing or corrupt cloud models fall back to procedural furniture instead of
  breaking the scene.

### Delivery

- Android version code: `10047`.
- Cloud models are hosted outside the AAB and download only when required.
- The R2 development catalog was verified with 32 public model downloads and a
  byte-identical 32-entry manifest.
